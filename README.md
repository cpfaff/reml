EMLR
=====

`EMLR` is a R package to access and import data along the conventions of the
Ecological Metadata Language (eml). While accessing data, given the metadata in
EML format, is a priority development task, there is a also the long term goal
to provide an export mechanism so data objects can be augmented with metadata
right from within R.
